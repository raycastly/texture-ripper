## Reporting Bugs
- Use the [Bug Report template](../../issues/new?template=bug_report.yml).  
- Always report **one bug per issue**.  
- Include clear steps to reproduce the bug.  
- Screenshots, videos or console logs are very helpful.

---

## Suggesting Features
- Use the [Feature Request template](../../issues/new?template=feature_request.yml).  
- Explain the problem your idea solves.  
- Be clear about what you’d like to see happen.  
- If you’ve considered alternatives, include them.  

---

## Pull Requests
- Keep PRs focused: one change or fix per PR.  
- Make sure your code builds and runs without errors.  
- Write [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) (e.g. `fix: crash when exporting PNG` or `feat: add batch export option`).
- Update documentation or examples if your changes affect usage.  
- Small improvements (typo fixes, refactoring, tests) are welcome too.  

---

## Tips
- Be respectful and constructive in discussions.  
- If you’re unsure about an idea, open an issue first before writing code.  
- Contributions of **tests**, **docs**, and **examples** are just as valuable as new features.

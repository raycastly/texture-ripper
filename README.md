## 🚀 How to Use
- Go to https://raycastly.github.io/texture-ripper
- Upload 1 or more images
- Lock the images so they don't accidentaly move
- Add rectangles in two ways:
	- Either press the "Add Rectangle" button, then position the vertices
	- Enter the drawing mode (W.I.P.) and then draw the vertices
- At any point you can press "Extract All" to extract the textures
- On the right panel you can set up the output resolution of your texture atlas
- Then you can position, rotate, scale the extracted textures in your atlas
- At any point you can alter the polygons in the left panel and simply update your textures by pressing "Extract All" again
- Once you are satisfied, decide if you want a transparent background or not, then click on Export and you are done!
